# The Node.js Internationalization (i18n) Working Group

Here you can find contribution guides, discuss ideas, and find out how to join meetings. This repo also contains the source for the English Node.js API documentation.

## Usage

This repository can be installed as an npm package. See [guides/NPM_PACKAGE.md](guides/NPM_PACKAGE.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## About

The Node.js i18n Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of both Internationalization (i18n) within the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project. This Working Group serves as a function of the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC)

### What we're responsible for

- The implementation of i18n support including [ECMA-402](https://tc39.github.io/ecma402/) within [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).
- Ensuring Node.js is compliant with common standards such as [Unicode](https://unicode.org/), [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/), and harmonized with other globalization efforts.

### What i18n (Internationalization) means to us

Maintaining the ability for Node.js to [effectively support](https://nodejs.org/api/intl.html#intl_internationalization_support) the cultural & socio-linguistic preferences of all international users, through:

- [Unicode](https://unicode.org) processing and related services to support text written in all human languages.
- APIs and implementations which support the specific cultural & socio-linguistic preferences, such as localized methods for displaying dates & times.
- The ability for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and its related modules & applications to be translated into distinct human languages.

### Summary of our Responsibilities

1. i18n support for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and its related initiatives.
2. Ensuring i18n compliance with all relevant standards such as [Unicode](https://unicode.org) and [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402).
3. Continual refinement and maintenance of the i18n Working Group's processes, platform service accounts, and related module repositories & source code.


## Contributing

### Translations

All translations are managed through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs). If you want to help translate Node.js, please read [translation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/blob/main/TRANSLATION.md).

### Internationalization

Help make sure Node.js applications continue to support all the world’s
languages and cultures. See [i18n API](./guides/I18N-API.md) to get started.
