# Node.js Internationalization

## About

The Node.js i18n Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) within the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project. This Working Group serves as a function of the [Node.js Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

#### What we're responsible for
* The ongoing translation of the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project's textual content into every language of its users.
* The implementation of i18n support including [ECMA-402](https://tc39.github.io/ecma402/) within [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node). 
* Ensuring Node.js is compliant with common standards like [Unicode](https://unicode.org/), [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/), and other globalization efforts.

#### What i18n means to us
* Making the Node.js project's API documentation, site, and tutorial content available in every language.
* Maintaining the ability for Node.js to effectively process text written in human languages (e.g., Unicode character processing).
* Providing services which support the cultural & socio-linguistic preferences of all of our international users,
such as localized methods for displaying dates & times that are common to specific regions.
* Building and maintaining i18n module(s) that support [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).

#### What l10n means to us
* The ability for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and its related modules & applications to be translated into distinct human languages. 
* The responsibility to provide translators with a useful platform to work in.
* The responsibility to provision Node.js with all l10n assets, through coordination with [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) core contributors.
* Members of this group are not responsible for performing the act of translation itself.


## Summary of our Responsibilities
1. Supporting l10n groups who are actively translating the content of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) into their own languages.
2. i18n support for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and its related initiatives.
3. Ensuring i18n compliance with all common character encoding standards such as Unicode, and ECMA.
4. Continual refinement and maintenance of the i18n Working Group's processes, platform service accounts, and related module repositories & source code.

### Our Current Trajectory
Please read [this article](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/internationalizing-node-js-fe7761798b0a) to get up to speed on our current trajectory.


## Inter-project relationships
In order to ensure best practices, this working group may work directly with representatives of similar i18n efforts from other external projects. For example:
* [Electron i18n](https://github.com/electron/electron-i18n)
* [W3C i18n Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/core/Overview)
* [V8 i18n](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/i18n-support)
