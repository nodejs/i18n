Here you can find contribution guides, discuss ideas, and find out how to join meetings. This repo also contains the source for the English Node.js API documentation.

## Usage

This repository can be installed as an npm package. See [guides/NPM_PACKAGE.md](guides/NPM_PACKAGE.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## About

The Node.js i18n Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of both Internationalization (i18n) within the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) project. This Working Group serves as a function of the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC)

### What we're responsible for

- The implementation of i18n support including [ECMA-402](https://tc39.github.io/ecma402/) within [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node).
- Ensuring Node.js is compliant with common standards such as [Unicode](https://unicode.org/), [CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/), and harmonized with other globalization efforts.

### What i18n (Internationalization) means to us

Maintaining the ability for Node.js to [effectively support](https://nodejs.org/api/intl.html#intl_internationalization_support) the cultural & socio-linguistic preferences of all international users, through:

- [Unicode](https://unicode.org) processing and related services to support text written in all human languages.
- APIs and implementations which support the specific cultural & socio-linguistic preferences, such as localized methods for displaying dates & times.
- The ability for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and its related modules & applications to be translated into distinct human languages.

### Summary of our Responsibilities

1. i18n support for [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and its related initiatives.
2. Ensuring i18n compliance with all relevant standards such as [Unicode](https://unicode.org) and [ECMA-402](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402).
3. Continual refinement and maintenance of the i18n Working Group's processes, platform service accounts, and related module repositories & source code.


## Contributing

### Translations

All translations are managed through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/nodejs). If you want to help translate Node.js, please read [translation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/blob/main/TRANSLATION.md).

### Internationalization

Help make sure Node.js applications continue to support all the world’s
languages and cultures. See [i18n API](./guides/I18N-API.md) to get started.
