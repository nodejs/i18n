# Offboarding

Dette dokument er en tjekliste med ting at gøre, når en kollaboratør bliver emeritus eller forlader projektet.

* Fjern kollaboratøren fra holdet @nodejs/collaborators.
* Open a fast-track pull request to move the Collaborator to Collaborator Emeriti in README.md.
* Email the TSC mailing list to notify TSC members that the Collaborator is moving to Collaborator Emeritus.
* Determine what GitHub teams the Collaborator belongs to. In consultation with the Collaborator, determine which of those teams they should be removed from.
    * Some teams may also require a pull request to remove the Collaborator from a team listing. For example, if someone is removed from @nodejs/build, they should also be removed from the Build WG README.md file in the https://github.com/nodejs/build repository.
