# How to write a test for the Node.js project

## What is a test?

Most tests in Node.js core are JavaScript programs that exercise a functionality
provided by Node.js and check that it behaves as expected. Tests should exit
with code `0` on success. A test will fail if:

- It exits by setting `process.exitCode` to a non-zero number.
  - This is usually done by having an assertion throw an uncaught Error.
  - Occasionally, using `process.exit(code)` may be appropriate.
- It never exits. In this case, the test runner will terminate the test because
  it sets a maximum time limit.

Tests can be added for multiple reasons:

- When adding new functionality.
- When fixing regressions and bugs.
- When expanding test coverage.


## Test structure

Let's analyze this very basic test from the Node.js test suite:

```javascript
1  'use strict';
2  const common = require('../common');
3  const http = require('http');
4  const assert = require('assert');
5
6  const server = http.createServer(common.mustCall((req, res) => {
7    res.end('ok');
8  }));
9  server.listen(common.PORT, () => {
10   http.get({
11     port: common.PORT,
12     headers: {'Test': 'DÃ¼sseldorf'}
13   }, common.mustCall((res) => {
14     assert.equal(res.statusCode, 200);
15     server.close();
16   }));
17 });
```

**Lines 1-2**

```javascript
'use strict';
const common = require('../common');
```

These two lines are mandatory and should be included on every test.
The `common` module is a helper module that provides useful tools for the tests.
If for some reason, no functionality from `common` is used, it should still be
included like this:

```javascript
require('../common');
```

Why? It checks for leaks of globals.

**Lines 3-4**

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const assert = require('assert');
```

These modules are required for the test to run. Except for special cases, these
modules should only include core modules.
The `assert` module is used by most of the tests to check that the assumptions
for the test are met.
Note that require statements are sorted, in
[ASCII](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html) order (digits, upper
case, `_`, lower case).

**Lines 6-17**

This is the body of the test. This test is quite simple, it just tests that an
HTTP server accepts `non-ASCII` characters in the headers of an incoming
request. Interesting things to notice:

- The use of `common.PORT` as the listening port. Always use `common.PORT`
  instead of using an arbitrary value, as it allows to run tests in parallel
  safely, as they are not trying to reuse the same port another test is already
  using.
- The use of `common.mustCall` to check that some callbacks/listeners are
  called.
- The HTTP server is closed once all the checks have run. This way, the test can
  exit gracefully. Remember that for a test to succeed, it must exit with a
  status code of 0.

## General recommendations

### Timers

The use of timers is discouraged, unless timers are being tested. There are
multiple reasons for this. Mainly, they are a source of flakiness. For a thorough
explanation go [here](https://github.com/nodejs/testing/issues/27).

In the event a timer is needed, it's recommended using the
`common.platformTimeout()` method, that allows setting specific timeouts
depending on the platform. For example:

```javascript
const timer = setTimeout(fail, common.platformTimeout(4000));
```

will create a 4-seconds timeout, except for some platforms where the delay will
be multiplied for some factor.

### The *common* API

Make use of the helpers from the `common` module as much as possible.

One interesting case is `common.mustCall`. The use of `common.mustCall` may
avoid the use of extra variables and the corresponding assertions. Let's explain
this with a real test from the test suite.

```javascript
'use strict';
var common = require('../common');
var assert = require('assert');
var http = require('http');

var request = 0;
var response = 0;
process.on('exit', function() {
  assert.equal(request, 1, 'http server "request" callback was not called');
  assert.equal(response, 1, 'http request "response" callback was not called');
});

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  request++;
  res.end();
}).listen(common.PORT, function() {
  var options = {
    agent: null,
    port: this.address().port
  };
  http.get(options, function(res) {
    response++;
    res.resume();
    server.close();
  });
});
```

This test could be greatly simplified by using `common.mustCall` like this:

```javascript
'use strict';
var common = require('../common');
var assert = require('assert');
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(common.mustCall(function(req, res) {
  res.end();
})).listen(common.PORT, function() {
  var options = {
    agent: null,
    port: this.address().port
  };
  http.get(options, common.mustCall(function(res) {
    res.resume();
    server.close();
  }));
});

```

### Flags

Some tests will require running Node.js with specific command line flags set. To
accomplish this, a `// Flags: ` comment should be added in the preamble of the
test followed by the flags. For example, to allow a test to require some of the
`internal/*` modules, the `--expose-internals` flag should be added.
A test that would require `internal/freelist` could start like this:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Flags: --expose-internals

require('../common');
const assert = require('assert');
const freelist = require('internal/freelist');
```

### Assertions

When writing assertions, prefer the strict versions:

* `assert.strictEqual()` over `assert.equal()`
* `assert.deepStrictEqual()` over `assert.deepEqual()`

When using `assert.throws()`, if possible, provide the full error message:

```js
assert.throws(
  () => {
    throw new Error('Wrong value');
  },
  /^Error: Wrong value$/ // Instead of something like /Wrong value/
);
```

### ES.Next features

For performance considerations, we only use a selected subset of ES.Next
features in JavaScript code in the `lib` directory. However, when writing
tests, it is encouraged to use ES.Next features that have already landed
in the ECMAScript specification. For example:

* `let` and `const` over `var`
* Template literals over string concatenation
* Arrow functions when appropriate

## Naming Test Files

Test files are named using kebab casing. The first component of the name is
`test`. The second is the module or subsystem being tested. The third is usually
the method or event name being tested. Subsequent components of the name add
more information about what is being tested.

For example, a test for the `beforeExit` event on the `process` object might be
named `test-process-before-exit.js`. If the test specifically checked that arrow
functions worked correctly with the `beforeExit` event, then it might be named
`test-process-before-exit-arrow-functions.js`.

## Imported Tests

### Web Platform Tests

Some of the tests for the WHATWG URL implementation (named
`test-whatwg-url-*.js`) are imported from the
[Web Platform Tests Project](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/url).
These imported tests will be wrapped like this:

```js
/* eslint-disable */
/* WPT Refs:
   https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/8791bed/url/urlsearchparams-stringifier.html
   License: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-copyright.html
*/

// Test code

/* eslint-enable */
```

If you want to improve tests that have been imported this way, please send
a PR to the upstream project first. When your proposed change is merged in
the upstream project, send another PR here to update Node.js accordingly.
Be sure to update the hash in the URL following `WPT Refs:`.
