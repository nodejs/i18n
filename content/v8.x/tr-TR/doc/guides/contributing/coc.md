# Davranış Kuralları

Node.js projesi, *tüm* katılımcılardan takip etmeleri beklenen [Davranış Kurallarına](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) sahiptir. Bu yönetmelik, tüm katkıda bulunanlar için *minimum* davranış beklentilerini belirler.

Node.js'ye katkıda bulunan bir kişi olarak, diğer katılımcılara ve topluluğa karşı nasıl davranmayı ve etkileşimde bulunmayı tercih ederseniz, bu sadece kendinize değil, bir bütün olarak projeye de yansıyacaktır. The Code of Conduct is designed and intended, above all else, to help establish a culture within the project that allows anyone and everyone who wants to contribute to feel safe doing so.

Should any individual act in any way that is considered in violation of the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), corrective actions will be taken. It is possible, however, for any individual to *act* in such a manner that is not in violation of the strict letter of the Code of Conduct guidelines while still going completely against the spirit of what that Code is intended to accomplish.

Open, diverse, and inclusive communities live and die on the basis of trust. Contributors can disagree with one another so long as they trust that those disagreements are in good faith and everyone is working towards a common goal.

## Bad actors

All contributors to Node.js tacitly agree to abide by both the letter and spirit of the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Failure, or unwillingness, to do so will result in contributions being respectfully declined.

A *bad actor* is someone who repeatedly violates the *spirit* of the Code of Conduct through consistent failure to self-regulate the way in which they interact with other contributors in the project. In doing so, bad actors alienate other contributors, discourage collaboration, and generally reflect poorly on the project as a whole.

Being a bad actor may be intentional or unintentional. Typically, unintentional bad behavior can be easily corrected by being quick to apologize and correct course *even if you are not entirely convinced you need to*. Giving other contributors the benefit of the doubt and having a sincere willingness to admit that you *might* be wrong is critical for any successful open collaboration.

Don't be a bad actor.
